# Portfolio Website

This is my portfolio website located at https://dmwspace.github.io/portfolio-page/. 

### Technologies used

I used React to code this site. Create-React-App was used to set up the project. For the navbar I used React-Router. For the projects page I used BootstrapCSS to style the page while on all the other pages vanilla CSS was used for styling. I used a NPM package called react-pdf to render my resume in PDF format on my Resume page. I also used the package gh-pages to publish the site to Github pages.

### Problems

The biggest problem that I had came when I wanted to publish the site to github pages. I had never published a React site to github pages but I found that the gh-pages package made the process relatively easy.
